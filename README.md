# Static Page Build #

### Task ###

Please create a static, responsive page based on supplied designs. We realise it will take some time, so you are not expected to complete it all - but try to get as much of it done.

### Details ###

Hex values for the colours used are:

* Dark blue: #004c6d

* Text colour: #666666


### Requirements ###

* Complete the task using HTML5 and CSS - or any CSS Pre-Processor of your choice.
* We would like to see you create your own grid rather than relying on a CSS framework.

### What we're looking for ###

* Semantic mark-up
* Easy to read and understand by novice developers
* Bonus - If you use a CSS architecture
* Bonus - Make carousel interactive using JavaScript or plain HTML5/CSS
